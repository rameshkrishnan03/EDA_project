#Problem Statement 

The exploratory data analysis project entails thoroughly examining a specific dataset using Python to extract meaningful insights, discover hidden patterns, and elucidate relationships among variables. The primary objective is to comprehensively understand the nature of the data, unveil any underlying trends or irregularities, and preprocess it for subsequent analysis or modeling tasks. This entails conducting a systematic investigation into the dataset's characteristics, including its structure, distributional properties, and inter-variable correlations, employing both visualizations and statistical techniques. By meticulously scrutinizing the dataset, the project aims to address pertinent research questions or hypotheses, providing actionable insights and facilitating informed decision-making processes in relevant domains.
